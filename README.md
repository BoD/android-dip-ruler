## What is it?
This is a ruler in the Android "dip" ([Device Independent Pixel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement)) unit.

You can print it, cut it and give it to your designer.

## Why?
I've found that the concept of dp is not that easy to explain / understand.

Designers are used to think in pixels (especially if they also work on iOS projects).

Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, and so this ruler will make it immediately obvious that ***the dp is a physical unit of length***.

Some essential information is also present on the ruler:
- Definition of a dp
- List of Android logical densities (*ldpi*, *mdpi*, etc.) with their properties

And of course it can also be actually used to measure things (screens…) since it **is** a ruler :)


## Miscellaneous

- Made with Inkscape
- Available in A4 and US Letter
- The ruler is rotated in the page to reduce the risk of being larger than the printable area
- When printing, make sure to **not** scale the page (or force it to scale at 100%), to preserve exact sizes
